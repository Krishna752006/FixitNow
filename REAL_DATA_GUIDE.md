## Important Notes

‚úÖ **Real data only appears after:**

‚ùå **Data won't show if:**
- No users have signed up
- No jobs have been created
- Jobs are still pending (not completed)
- Users haven't verified their accounts

## Troubleshooting Real Data

### If Users Don't Appear in Admin:
1. Make sure users signed up successfully
2. Check they're in the database: `db.users.find()`
3. Verify they have `userType: 'user'` or `userType: 'professional'`

### If Jobs Don't Appear in Admin:
1. Make sure jobs were created by signed-up users
2. Check they're in the database: `db.jobs.find()`
3. Verify they have proper `userId` and `professionalId`

### If Financial Data Doesn't Show:
1. Make sure jobs are **COMPLETED** (not pending/in_progress)
2. Check jobs have `finalPrice` set
3. Verify `status: 'completed'` in database
